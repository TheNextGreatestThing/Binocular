# Binocular
Binocular is a program that leverages AI and advanced gastric cell research to enhance cancer detection capabilities. Designed to expand on existing studies in oncology, it applies machine learning algorithms to analyze intricate patterns and anomalies within gastric cell data, facilitating the detection of cancerous nuances. The original research paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02473
Binocular, expands on this foundational research by applying a quadrant-based occlusion sensitivity technique, a perturbation-based attribution method commonly used in explainable AI to identify the most diagnostically relevant regions of cellular images for cancer detection. 

The Binocular executable along with its supplements are available here(Note that Biocular has limited support for different architectures): https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/apoio145t7gazbbbvc84z/Binocular-v1.0.1.zip?rlkey=xxmhaywhqntsyjak52ls4zr0w&st=qyvu9zdu&dl=0
