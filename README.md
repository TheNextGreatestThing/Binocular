# Binocular
Binocular is a program that leverages AI and advanced gastric cell research to enhance cancer detection capabilities. Designed to expand on existing studies in oncology, it applies machine learning algorithms to analyze intricate patterns and anomalies within gastric cell data, facilitating the detection of cancerous nuances. The original research paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02473
Binocular expands on this by dissecting images into quadrants and analyzing the significance of each smaller section in producing a specific diagnostic result for the entire image. This technique strives to increase the precision with which these nuances are detected.
